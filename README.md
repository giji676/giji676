## Hello there

# About Me

I am a Computer Science student at Royal Holloway University of London and a passionate fullstack developer with experience across a variety of technologies:

- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (DRF), PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React, PyQt
- **Networking & APIs:** REST APIs, WebSockets
- **DevOps & Deployment:** Nginx, Docker

## Projects

I am currently developing a **movie streaming service**, which is the largest and most ambitious project I've undertaken so far. The platform allows users to:

- Stream movies directly from a custom server
- Create accounts to track watch progress
- Save movies to watch later
- Join **watch parties** to stream movies in sync with other users
- Lots more features to come

The system features **automated movie sourcing**, using the TMDb API and torrent downloads, and converts downloaded files into **HLS format** with FFmpeg for smooth streaming. This project has given me hands-on experience with real-world challenges in backend development, media streaming, and real-time synchronization.

## Skills & Interests

I enjoy working primarily in **Python**, with a focus on backend and fullstack development. I'm familiar with building desktop applications with PyQt, and I have experience deploying applications using Docker and Nginx. While I am still exploring CI/CD and testing, I am eager to deepen my knowledge and implement best practices in future projects.

## Career Goals

I am aiming to build a career as a **backend or fullstack developer**, preferably working with Python. I am particularly interested in challenging projects that combine scalable backend systems with real-time features and robust user experiences. I am looking for opportunities where I can contribute to innovative applications while growing as a developer.
